### Files

#### Source code

##### File "settings"

All text files have to be in UTF-8 (without BOM) encoding (generally UTF-8 on GNU/Linux and ISO 8859-15 on MS Windows) and LF character newline (sometime called UNIX newline/endline) (Windows generally used CRLF).
Unfortunately, by default some text editors save with the same encoding and character newline of your OS.
In order to force to use UTF-8 and LF for this project in Eclipse, do right click on the project in "Package Explorer", then "Properties", in the right panel select "Resource", now you are on the right and enough intelligent to find what to change.


##### Coding style

We use english, so please use it everywhere in the project (messages, function names, doc, etc).

Names of variables, functions/methods, classes and everything else have to be clear, even if the name is a little longer.
You also do not have to forget to create documentation.

Following the [PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is a good thing, even if the project does not use the Python language.

#### Text files

If you need to make a structured document, you should consider [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
For example, this document uses the Markdown syntax.

For longer texts or presentations, [LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/) could be a good option.

### Git

#### Installation

##### Debian

The above text should also work on derivatives of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), like [Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/), [gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/) or Ubuntu.

You have to install the git package and its dependencies.
You must have [SuperUser/root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) rights, that you can have with `su` or `su command`.
You can use `apt-get install`, `aptitude install` (if [aptitude](https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude) is installed) or a graphical user interface with [Synaptic](https://wiki.debian.org/Synaptic) (if it is installed).

##### Fedora, CentOS and RHEL

You have to install the git package and its dependencies.
With SuperUser/root rights, you can use `yum install` or a graphical user interface with [Yum Extender](http://www.yumex.dk/) (if it is installed).

##### Microsoft Windows (and ReactOS?) and Apple OS X

Download it on [the official website](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.

#### Use

If you do not know how to use it, you must read a documentation (like [the official one](http://www.git-scm.com/doc)).

Use `git status` to check that your modifications will be commited.
You have to pull before push.

git provides only a text shell interface.
However, you can install a graphical user interface for it (like [git-cola](https://git-cola.github.io/) or [gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/)).
